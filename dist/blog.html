            the main question is whether doing great in Competitive Programming can increase your chances in getting referred at the big companies.

Let’s answer this question together - shall we?

So ask yourself, will the chance of getting referred due to CF rating vary from company to company? Won’t it depend on the manager/shortlisting team whether they are aware of what Codeforces is?

The Downside:

When a manager looks at the resume, he/she might/might not get impressed by the Codeforces rating - depending on whether they have idea about what exactly is Codeforces. You need to realise that sites like Codeforces, Codechef are relatively new and managers in this generation are a bit not aware of things like Codeforces, Codechef. Even if they have heard sometimes, they might not be aware of what does 2100 rating mean on Codeforces?

The Upside:

Ofcourse, this is not the case always. If you look at companies like Google, Facebook, Directi - they have their own competitive programming competitions like Hacker Cup, APAC, CodeJam, Codechef, etc. The context of Competitive Programming is well established in such companies.

In Summary:

In Microsoft, your chances to get referred will only increase if your resume talks abour C#, .Net, Azure.
My friends who are great competitive programmers were not even shortlisted by Microsoft as they think the work we do and the skills they have in resume don’t match that much.
In companies like Google, Facebook, Directi that have some context about Competitive Programming established in their company, this can help you.
But you always need to consider the fact that if you are getting referred as a lateral hire i.e you are already working in some other company, then the focus lies more on whether your skills match with the skills needed in new company + what did you learn while working in the company that you are planning to leave.
